      <p class="glacierDescription">Sólheimajökull glacier is an outlet from the mighty Mýrdalsjökull and is surrounded by some of Iceland’s most grand volcanoes and during summertime, a glacier lagoon forms in front of the glacier only adding to the charm of the <br>
        location. This popular day tour is the perfect way to get in real contact with the true reason behind the name Ice-land!
